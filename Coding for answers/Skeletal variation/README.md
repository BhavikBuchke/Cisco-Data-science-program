# 🧬 Skeletal Variation Across Species  
### Comparative Analysis for Evolutionary Biology  
*(Part of My Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio)*

## 🔎 Project Context

This repository contains a comparative data analysis project that forms part of my broader **Data Analytics and Data Science GitHub portfolio**.  
The project applies structured data analysis techniques to **biological and evolutionary datasets**, demonstrating analytical thinking beyond traditional business use cases.

By comparing skeletal structures across species, this analysis highlights how data-driven approaches can support **historical and evolutionary insights**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Explore skeletal structures of the human body
- Compare bone characteristics across **humans, mammals, and birds**
- Identify similarities and differences that support evolutionary reasoning

The project focuses on **comparative exploratory analysis**, not predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

This analysis integrates multiple CSV datasets representing skeletal structures across species:

- **`adult-human-skeleton.csv`**  
  Human skeletal data used as the baseline for comparison

- **`mammal-neck-bones.csv`**  
  Neck bone data from a variety of mammalian species

- **`bird-neck-bones.csv`**  
  Neck bone data from bird species for cross-class comparison

These datasets enable structured, cross-species analysis of skeletal variation.
