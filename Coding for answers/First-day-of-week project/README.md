# 📊 Calendar Conventions Analysis  
### Part of My Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio

## 🔎 Project Context

This repository contains one of several analytical projects in my **GitHub Data Analytics & Data Science portfolio**.  
Each project is designed to demonstrate **practical problem-solving**, **data manipulation**, and **insight generation** using real-world datasets.

This specific analysis addresses a globally relevant and culturally nuanced question:

> **What is considered the first day of the week across different countries, populations, and regions?**

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze international calendar conventions
- Compare territorial vs population-weighted perspectives
- Identify regional patterns using structured data analysis

This project emphasizes **data reasoning and aggregation logic**, rather than visualization-heavy storytelling.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

The analysis integrates multiple datasets:

- **`first-day-of-week.csv`**  
  Officially recognized first day of the week for each territory.

- **`population.csv`**  
  Population data used to weight calendar conventions by number of people.

- **`four-regions.csv`**  
  Maps territories to global regions for regional-level analysis.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Python (Pandas)
- Working with multiple datasets
- Data merging and joins
- Group-based aggregation and summarization
- Analytical reasoning and interpretation
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab workflows

---

## 🔬 Key Analyses Performed

### 1. Territory-Based Analysis
- Count of territories that consider:
  - Friday
  - Saturday
  - Sunday
  - Monday  
  as the first day of the week.

### 2. Population-Weighted Analysis
- Merging calendar and population datasets
- Calculating how many people globally start their week on each day

### 3. Regional Perspective
- Aggregating results by continent-level regions
- Identifying dominant and mixed calendar conventions per region

---

## 💡 Insights Generated

- Calendar norms vary significantly across the world
- Population-weighted insights differ meaningfully from territory counts
- Regional aggregation highlights cultural and geopolitical influences on time conventions
- “Global standards” often reflect regional dominance rather than universal agreement
