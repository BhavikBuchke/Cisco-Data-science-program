# 👖 Jean Pocket Measurements Analysis  
### Gender & Design-Based Comparison Across Popular Brands  
*(Part of My Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio)*

## 🔎 Project Context

This repository contains a data analysis project examining **jean pocket dimensions across popular clothing brands**, with a focus on **gender-based and style-based differences**.  
The project forms part of my broader **Data Analytics and Data Science GitHub portfolio**, showcasing the application of data analysis to real-world consumer and design-related questions.

This analysis demonstrates how structured data can be used to evaluate **product design equity and usability**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze pocket size measurements across multiple jean brands
- Compare pocket dimensions between **men’s and women’s jeans**
- Evaluate differences across **skinny and straight styles**
- Identify systematic design patterns in pocket sizing

The focus is on **exploratory and comparative data analysis**, not predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

The analysis is based on the following dataset:

- **`jean-pocket-measurements.csv`**  
  Contains pocket measurements for **20 popular brands**  
  Four jean types per brand:
  - Men’s Skinny
  - Men’s Straight
  - Women’s Skinny
  - Women’s Straight  

All jeans were standardized to a **32-inch waistband**.

### Measurements Included
- `height_front` – Maximum front pocket height (cm)
- `height_back` – Maximum back pocket height (cm)
- `width_front` – Maximum front pocket width (cm)
- `width_back` – Maximum back pocket width (cm)

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Python
- Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Group-based aggregation and comparison
- Gender- and category-based analysis
- Descriptive statistics
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab workflow

## 🔬 Key Analyses Performed

- Comparison of pocket dimensions across brands
- Gender-based analysis of pocket size differences
- Style-based comparison (skinny vs straight)
- Evaluation of front vs back pocket usability
- Identification of consistent design trends

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Women’s jeans tend to have **significantly smaller pockets** than men’s jeans
- Skinny styles generally feature **reduced pocket dimensions**
- Pocket size differences are consistent across brands
- Design choices appear systematic rather than brand-specific
