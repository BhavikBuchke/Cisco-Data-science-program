# 🏝️ World’s Largest Islands Analysis  
### Geographic Size, Regional Distribution & Political Composition  
*(Part of My Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio)*

## 🔎 Project Context

This repository contains a data analysis project that explores the **largest islands in the world**, with a focus on geographic size, tropical distribution, regional representation, and political composition.  
The project is part of my broader **Data Analytics and Data Science GitHub portfolio**, demonstrating the application of structured data analysis to **geographical and geopolitical datasets**.

This analysis highlights how data can be used to answer spatial and regional questions in a clear, analytical manner.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objectives of this project are to:

- Identify the **10 largest islands located in the tropics**
- Determine the **largest islands within each global region**
- Analyze island size distribution using **rank vs area**
- Identify islands that are **shared by multiple countries**

The focus is on **exploratory and comparative analysis**, not predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

The analysis is based on the following dataset:

- **`largest-islands.csv`**  
  Contains information about the world’s largest islands, including:
  - Island name
  - Area
  - Rank by size
  - Geographic region
  - Country or countries associated with each island

---

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Python
- Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Geographic and regional data analysis
- Ranking and sorting techniques
- Data visualization (line graph)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab workflow

---

## 🔬 Key Analyses Performed

- Filtering islands located within tropical latitudes
- Identifying the top 10 largest tropical islands
- Grouping islands by region to find the largest per region
- Creating a line graph with:
  - **X-axis:** Island rank (largest to smallest)
  - **Y-axis:** Island area
- Identifying islands governed by **multiple countries**

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Tropical regions contain several of the world’s largest islands
- Island size distribution shows a steep decline after the top-ranked islands
- Some islands span multiple countries, reflecting geopolitical complexity
- Regional analysis highlights significant variation in island size dominance
