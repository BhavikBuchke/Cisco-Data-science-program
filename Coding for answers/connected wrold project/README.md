# 🌐 Our Connected World  
### Global Internet Adoption & Population Growth Analysis  
*(Part of My Data Analytics & Data Science Portfolio)*

## 🔎 Project Context

This repository contains a data analysis project that examines the **rapid rise of the Internet** and evaluates **how close the world is to becoming fully connected**.  
It forms part of my broader **Data Analytics and Data Science GitHub portfolio**, which focuses on extracting insights from real-world, globally relevant datasets.

The project combines **population growth data** with **internet adoption metrics** to understand connectivity trends across time and continents.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Analyze historical world population growth
- Examine the rise of internet users globally and by continent
- Compare population growth against internet adoption rates
- Evaluate disparities in global digital connectivity

The focus is on **exploratory and comparative analysis**, not predictive modeling.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used

This analysis integrates multiple datasets related to population and internet usage:

- **`historical-world-population.csv`**  
  Historical global population data over time

- **`world-internet-users.csv`**  
  Global internet user counts across years

- **`extension-historical-population-by-continent.csv`**  
  Population growth data segmented by continent

- **`extension-internet-users-by-continent.csv`**  
  Internet adoption data segmented by continent

Together, these datasets enable a continent-level and global view of connectivity trends.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Python
- Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time-based trend analysis
- Multi-dataset merging and comparison
- Grouping and aggregation by region
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab workflow

---

## 🔬 Key Analyses Performed

- Analysis of historical world population growth
- Examination of global internet adoption trends
- Comparison between population size and internet usage
- Continent-wise analysis of connectivity growth
- Identification of regions with high and low internet penetration

---

## 💡 Key Insights

- Internet adoption has grown rapidly but unevenly across the globe
- Population growth does not directly translate to equal connectivity
- Significant digital divides exist between continents
- While global connectivity is increasing, a fully connected world has not yet been achieved
