# Cisco Data Science Program — Coding for Answers

## Overview

This directory contains a curated collection of **data analysis projects and analytical exercises** completed as part of the **Cisco Data Science Program**.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate:
- How real-world questions are translated into data problems
- Clean, structured exploratory data analysis workflows
- Thoughtful use of Python and Pandas to derive insights
- Clear analytical reasoning supported by reproducible notebooks

Each project is self-contained and documented within its own folder.

## What to Expect in This Repository

Across the projects in this directory, you will find:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Careful inspection, filtering, grouping, and summarization of datasets.

- **Comparative & Descriptive Analysis**  
  Comparing groups, categories, regions, or entities to surface patterns.

- **Real-World Datasets**  
  Including cultural, scientific, geographic, perceptual, and social data.

- **Notebook-First Workflow**  
  Every analysis is performed in Jupyter Notebooks with supporting Markdown explanations.

- **Professional Documentation**  
  Each project includes a dedicated README that accurately reflects what the notebook does, the dataset used, and the insights derived.

## Project Organization

- Each **subfolder** represents a distinct analytical project
- Every project typically contains:
  - One or more Jupyter notebooks
  - The dataset(s) used for analysis
  - A project-specific README describing objectives, methods, and findings

Projects are designed to be:
- Independently understandable
- Focused on analytical clarity rather than model complexity
- Faithful to the actual computations performed in the notebook

---

## Portfolio Intent

This repository is part of a broader **data science portfolio** intended for:
- Recruiters
- Hiring managers
- Technical interviewers
- Mentors and peers

The emphasis is on **analytical thinking, correctness, and documentation quality**, rather than showcasing advanced modeling for its own sake.
